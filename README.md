Graph Framework
===============

 This is website to help draw and create graphs. The graphs are stored as .json files and are saved into a folder on the server, so they can be acsessed again at a later date. The tool supports bar graphs, pie charts, line graphs, cumulative line graphs and scatter graphs. To load old graphs you can either type the file name into the text box on the home page or click find graphs and search by a string, as well as filter by graph type. 

NOTE:
 If this tool is not working properly, please remember it has some php scripts and AJAX calls so requires to be run off a local server.
